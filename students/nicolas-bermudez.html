              <h3>Biography</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="description-holder">
              <p>I am a son, brother, friend, and student. I am an adventurer, an athlete, a visual artist, and an innovator; A lover of life. I aim to inspire others to open their minds, to travel, to think beyond any limits, to take chances, and to create. 

Every idea I encounter begins with one simple question: "why?" When we begin to question everything around us and everything within us, we start to understand that the complexity of our society is merely built upon the questions we ask. When we ask these questions daily, we begin to disrupt our own habits, challenge ourselves, grow, and learn like never before. Never stop questioning...

I grew up in two contrasting areas of the world: 
- Bogota, Colombia: A place where a simple life is the key to happiness and where a passion for life thrives even under turmoil
- Miami, Florida: A place where hard working immigrants took a leap of faith into America's opportunistic environment and where their children enjoy a privileged life full of opportunity. 

Having these experiences as well as my many travels has expanded the scope of my perspectives and has allowed me to remain humble and appreciative of the simple things in life: music, nature, love, laughing, dancing... while keeping one eye fixed on changing the future of the world we live in.
